In a business context, a cohort refers to a group of individuals or entities that share a common characteristic or experience within a defined period. This concept is often used in various areas such as marketing, sales, product development, and human resources to analyze and understand behaviors, trends, and outcomes over time. Here are a few examples of how cohorts can be used in business:

Customer Cohorts: Groups of customers who made their first purchase during the same time period (e.g., a month or a quarter). Analyzing customer cohorts helps businesses understand customer retention, lifetime value, and purchasing patterns.

Employee Cohorts: Groups of employees who were hired during the same period. This can help HR departments analyze employee retention, performance, and career progression.

Product Cohorts: Groups of products that were launched at the same time. This can be useful for understanding product performance, customer adoption rates, and the impact of marketing efforts.

Marketing Cohorts: Groups of users who responded to the same marketing campaign or joined through the same channel. This analysis helps in evaluating the effectiveness of different marketing strategies and channels.

1.The first step is to define the cohorts based on a specific characteristic or event. For example, in an e-commerce platform, cohorts could be defined based on the month of a userâ€™s first purchase.
Gather relevant data for analysis.
2.Determine the time intervals you want to analyze.
3.Group users into cohorts based on the defined characteristic or event.
4.Choose the key performance metrics you want to analyze.
5.Calculate the chosen metrics for each cohort over the specified time periods.
6.Create visualizations to present your findings effectively.
